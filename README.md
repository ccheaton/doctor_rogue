### WELCOME TO DOCTOR CHICK - THE ROGUE-LIKE

This is a community project from quartertothree.com. 


Doctor Chick is a rogue-like game inspired by the pulp style adventures of characters such as Indiana Jones and Allan Quatermain.  

Adventurers will embark on a journey of discovery through randomly generated environments on quests to recover a variety of ancient lost artifacts with mysterious powers!  Traditional rogue-like elements will be combined with puzzles, traps, monsters, combat, treasure-seeking and the ever present threat of an evil arch-enemy standing in the way of ultimate success!  

This project is in the early stages of development.  More information on the goals, structure and features of Doctor Chick can be found in the [Doctor Chick Design Briefing](https://github.com/ccheaton/doctor_rogue/blob/master/design_briefing.md).

Additional things to know:

* The Xcode project is in the `Doctor Rogue` directory.
* Resources and files that I used to create resources, fonts, etc. in the Xcode project are in the `_external_resources` directory.
* We're targeting iOS 5.1.1 to support the iPad 1. 
* When viewing the map, two fingers scroll and 3+ fingers will zoom in and out. The scroll and dampening rates can be balanced to make them more fluid.

Useful tools for working with the project and resources:

* [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org) (map editor)
* [Glyph Designer](http://www.71squared.com/en/glyphdesigner) (create bitmap fonts)
* [Zwoptex](http://www.zwopple.com/zwoptex/) (pack textures)
* [cocos2d](http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org) (game engine - download and look for tests for sample code)
* [HKTMXTiledMap](http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/forum/topic/17945/page/10#post-456910) (faster implementation of CCTMXTiledMap, but with only orthagonal view)
