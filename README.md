### DOCTOR CHICK aka DOCTOR ROGUE

This is a community project from quartertothree.com. It is in its very early stages. More info coming soon. 

For now, there's more info [here]
(http://www.quartertothree.com/game-talk/showthread.php?72745-Help-me-design-and-make-a-roguelike!&p=3379264&viewfull=1#post3379264) and [here]
(https://github.com/ccheaton/doctor_rogue/wiki/Editing-resources).

A few things to know:

* The Xcode project is in the `Doctor Rogue` directory.
* Resources and files that I used to create resources, fonts, etc. in the Xcode project are in the `_external_resources` directory.
* We're targeting iOS 5.1.1 to support the iPad 1. 

Useful tools for working with the project and resources:

* [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org) (map editor)
* [Glyph Designer](http://www.71squared.com/en/glyphdesigner) (create bitmap fonts)
* [Zwoptex](http://www.zwopple.com/zwoptex/) (pack textures)
* [cocos2d](http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org) (game engine - download and look for tests for sample code)
* [HKTMXTiledMap](http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/forum/topic/17945/page/10#post-456910) (faster implementation of CCTMXTiledMap, but with only orthagonal view)
