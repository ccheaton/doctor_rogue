##### CHANGELOG - Add changes to the top.

* 16 May 2013 - Clay - Added two layers to the test map and added some placeholder graphics for our main Character. Also added the GameObject and GameObjectSprite classes, which will be the superclasses from which our other classes of game objects and items are derived. Note that, when adding layers to a .tmx map, you must add at least one tile to each layer or there is an assertion when the map is loaded. Need to add a few tiles to the default tileset that can be used for marking things on these layers -- collisions, etc. They can be bright pink or something.
